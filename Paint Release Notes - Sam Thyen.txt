Pain(t) Version 0.6 - 10/4/2024

New Features:
*A button in the "Canvas" menu has been added to rotate the canvas in increments of 90 degrees.
*A button in the "Canvas" menu has been added for mirroring the canvas both horizontally and vertically.
*A new option in the "Canvas" menu has been added for sending autosave notifications. One notification will be sent per tab that is saved with autosave.
*A bug related to autosave functionality has been fixed which now allows for autosave to only save tabs with unsaved changes, increasing performance.
*Buttons in the toolbar and shape dropdown menu have been given icons.
*Buttons/items in the toolbar have been given tooltips providing their name and functionality.
*As a way to fix the misalignment bug with the select tool when the canvas is smaller than the window, smaller canvases will now position themselves in the upper left corner of the window rather than its center.
*A logging system has been added. The majority user interactions will be logged and recorded to paint_operations.log in the logs folder located in the project root.
*A star polygon tool that can draw a star with any number of points has been added. (it is used in a similar fashion to the polygon tool).

Known Issues:
*After using the line or shape tools the image will become slightly more fuzzy (besides the new line/shape just drawn).
*Rectangles, squares, ellipses, and circles can only be drawn when dragging from the top left to the bottom right.
*When clicking and not dragging with the select tool, an illegal argument exception will be very likely to be thrown to the command line. This does not impact user experience.
*Undo and redo do not account for canvas resizing. This can be especially evident when rotating the canvas in a way that will change its shape or simply when resizing it.

Improvements Expected in Next Release:
*Improvements to the codebase through some class restructuring/reorganization
*Full Javadoc documentation

Features Expected Further in the Future:
*Improvements on the rectangle, square, ellipse, and circle tools (primarily being able to draw when dragging in any direction)

Pain(t) Version 0.5 - 9/29/2024

New Features:
*A "Save All" button has been added to the "File" menu in the menu bar and saves all canvas' that have a file associated with them.

*An autosave timer can be viewed in the menu bar under "Canvas" options.
*A new check box in the "Canvas" portion of the menubar can toggle if the current image should be uploaded to the web server for viewing on localhost:8080. This option is
selectable per tab and and upon saving the tab (either through autosave or manual saving) a snapshot of the tab will be uploaded to the server. The option is disabled on a new unsaved canvas. The URL of the image
can be found at localhost:8080/"Name of image."
*A new data loss warning has been added within the "save as" dialog when file formats are being converted.
*For Pain(t) developers, 3 new units have been implemented.
	*One for the RightTriangleTool calculateRightTriangle method

	*One for the FileManager getFileExtension method
